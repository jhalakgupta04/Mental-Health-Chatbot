🧠 Mental Health Chatbot
A compassionate and intelligent chatbot designed to offer mental health support and emotional wellness assistance. This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversation, helping users express themselves, manage stress, and receive basic mental health guidance in a non-judgmental space.

🧾 Overview
Mental health is just as important as physical health, and access to support can sometimes be limited. This chatbot serves as a virtual companion to check in on users, respond to emotional cues, and promote mental wellness through friendly conversation.

Key goals:

Promote emotional expression and reflection

Offer supportive responses based on user sentiment

Encourage healthy mental practices and self-care

🔍 Example Use Cases
"I'm feeling anxious" → Chatbot provides calming techniques

"I need someone to talk to" → Supportive and empathetic conversation

"I feel stressed from exams" → Study break tips & stress-relief ideas

📌 Note
This chatbot is intended for educational and supportive purposes only and is not a substitute for professional mental health services.
